# An information system for working with the reference book of the subject area "Accounting for cars in the parking lot"
### Technologies
In this application, I use:
* C++ main language
* Qt for GUI
### Structures & algorithms
* AVL-Tree: adding, deleting to the right, searching, output, reading and writing to a file, reverse traversal.
* Hash-table: cell status (0,1,2), open addressing, hash function middle of the square, quadratic insertion point search, dynamic type.

Each node of the AVL-tree contains a hash-table.
The AVL-tree is built according to the make and model of the car.
The hash-table is built by date.
The search is conducted by make, model, and date.
The make and model and date are unique.
